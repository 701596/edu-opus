# Student & Staff Financial Automation System

## Overview
This document describes the fully automated financial synchronization system implemented in the education management application.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Student Fee Management - Automatic Calculation

#### When a Student is Added:
- **Total Fee Calculation**: 
  - If fee_type = 'monthly': `total_fee = fee_amount Ã— 12`
  - If fee_type = 'annually': `total_fee = fee_amount`
- **Initial State**: 
  - `remaining_fee = total_fee` (since no payments yet)
  - `payment_status = 'pending'`

**Database Trigger**: `trg_auto_init_student_fees` (BEFORE INSERT)
**Function**: `auto_init_student_fees()`

#### When a Payment is Added:
- **Automatic Recalculation**:
  - Total paid amount is calculated from all payments for the student
  - `remaining_fee = total_fee - total_paid`
  - Payment status is updated:
    - `paid`: remaining_fee â‰¤ 0
    - `partial`: some payment made but fee not fully paid
    - `pending`: no payments made

**Database Trigger**: `trg_update_student_fee` (AFTER INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE on payments)
**Function**: `update_student_remaining_fee()`

#### UI Updates - Real-time Sync:
- **Students Page**: Shows total_fee, remaining_fee, and payment_status for each student
- **Dashboard**: Displays total outstanding fees from all students
- **Remaining Fees Page**: Shows both student-level and fee-folder-level outstanding amounts
- **Reports**: Automatically reflects updated income and remaining fees

### 2. Staff Salary/Expense Management - Automatic Creation

#### When a Staff Member is Added:
- **Automatic Expense Entry**:
  - An expense record is automatically created in the `expenses` table
  - Category: "Salary"
  - Amount: Based on salary_type
    - Monthly: Uses salary as-is
    - Annually: Divides by 12 for monthly equivalent
  - Description: Includes staff name and position
  - Receipt Number: Auto-generated (`STF-EXP-{staff_id}`)

**Database Trigger**: `trg_auto_create_staff_expense` (AFTER INSERT on staff)
**Function**: `auto_create_staff_expense()`

#### When a Salary is Paid:
- **Automatic Expense Entry**:
  - Expense record is created automatically
  - Category: "Salary"
  - Linked to staff member
  - Includes all salary details (base, bonus, deductions, net)

**Database Trigger**: `trg_salary_to_expense` (AFTER INSERT on salaries)
**Function**: `auto_create_salary_expense()`

#### UI Updates:
- **Dashboard**: Shows total expenses including all salary payments
- **Expenses Page**: Displays all expense entries including auto-created salary expenses
- **Reports**: Automatically includes salary expenses in monthly calculations

### 3. Financial Reports - Automatic Recalculation

#### Triggers for Report Updates:
Reports are automatically recalculated whenever:
- A payment is added/updated/deleted
- An expense is added/updated/deleted
- A salary is added/updated/deleted

**Database Triggers**:
- `trg_update_report_on_payment` (AFTER INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE on payments)
- `trg_update_report_on_expense` (AFTER INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE on expenses)
- `trg_update_report_on_salary` (AFTER INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE on salaries)

**Function**: `update_monthly_report()` â†’ calls `recalc_monthly_report()`

**Report Calculation**:
```sql
total_income = SUM(payments.amount)
total_expense = SUM(expenses.amount) + SUM(salaries.net_amount)
net = total_income - total_expense
```

### 4. Fee Categories

#### Available Categories:
1. **School Fee** (newly added)
2. Tuition
3. Library
4. Lab Fees
5. Sports
6. Transport
7. Exam Fees
8. Other

## Database Schema Changes

### Students Table - New Columns:
- `total_fee` (NUMERIC): Total annual fee based on fee_amount and fee_type
- `remaining_fee` (NUMERIC): Outstanding amount after deducting all payments
- `payment_status` (TEXT): 'pending', 'partial', or 'paid'

### Automated Triggers:
1. `trg_auto_init_student_fees`: Initializes fees when student is added
2. `trg_update_student_fee`: Updates remaining fees on payment changes
3. `trg_auto_create_staff_expense`: Creates expense when staff is added
4. `trg_salary_to_expense`: Creates expense when salary is paid
5. `trg_update_report_on_payment`: Updates reports on payment changes
6. `trg_update_report_on_expense`: Updates reports on expense changes
7. `trg_update_report_on_salary`: Updates reports on salary changes

### Database Functions:
1. `auto_init_student_fees()`: Calculates initial total and remaining fees
2. `update_student_remaining_fee()`: Recalculates remaining fees based on payments
3. `auto_create_staff_expense()`: Creates expense entry for new staff
4. `auto_create_salary_expense()`: Creates expense entry for salary payments
5. `update_monthly_report()`: Triggers report recalculation
6. `recalc_monthly_report(year, month)`: Recalculates a specific month's report
7. `calculate_student_paid_fees(student_id)`: Calculates total paid by student
8. `calculate_student_remaining_fees(student_id)`: Calculates remaining fees

## Real-time Synchronization

All pages use Supabase real-time subscriptions:
- **Students Page**: Subscribes to students table changes
- **Dashboard**: Subscribes to students, payments, expenses, staff, salaries, fee_folders
- **Remaining Fees Page**: Subscribes to students, payments, fee_folders
- **Payments Page**: Subscribes to payments table changes
- **Expenses Page**: Subscribes to expenses table changes

When any data changes in the database (either from user actions or from triggers), all connected clients receive updates immediately and refresh their displays.
